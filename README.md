# Pong
My clone of the Atari's classic pong game! With Pygame and Python, I used Object Oriented Programming, made my own little AI, and used basic vector math to calculate angles of incidence.

## How to play
Simply clone the repo, and run in your ide of choice! I'm working on maybe getting a command line executable, but thats for later.
