# Pong
My clone of the Atari's classic pong game! With Pygame and Python, I used Object Oriented Programming, made my own little AI, and used basic vector math to calculate angles of incidence.

## How to play
Simply clone the repo, and run the file! Make sure to have (python)[https://www.python.org/downloads/] and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) installed.
